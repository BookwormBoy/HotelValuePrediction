# Hotel Value Prediction

The primary objective of this project was to develop and evaluate various machine learning models for accurately predicting the value of hotels based on their features, making it a regression problem. To achieve this, we did:

- **Data Pre-processing**: This involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We conducted a thorough EDA to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and uncover insights into factors influencing hotel
value.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: We trained and evaluated various machine learning models suitable for regression tasks, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and
gradient boosting models. We also explored hyperparameter tuning to optimise model performance.
